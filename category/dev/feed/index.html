					<description><![CDATA[NOTE: Updated for PowerShell 7, with Set-Clipboard available to supported platforms (Linux still requires xclip). You&#8217;ve just figured out the exact piece of information you need from a command line call. Now, how do you get it out of your terminal and take it somewhere else, like an email, chat, or document? Fortunately, there are already programs out there to make this easy. You can send the output from any command to one of these applications, and the output will be available in your clipboard. From there, you can paste it anywhere you please. In the case of Windows and macOS, there are programs to do this that come with the OS. On Linux, you can install a tool to have the same functionality. Windows Whether you are in Command Prompt or PowerShell (old-school or Core), you can use the Windows clip application to get output to the clipboard. Should it matter to you, clip will append an extra line break to whatever you feed it. command {some command} &#124; clip For example, to dump your file listing to the clipboard, you would run dir &#124; clip or Get-ChildItem . &#124; clip, with dir working in both cmd and all... <a class="continue-reading-link" href="https://www.patridgedev.com/2019/09/27/copy-command-line-output-to-the-clipboard-on-macos-windows-and-linux/"> Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594; </span></a>]]></description>

Full disclosure here: while I haven&#8217;t been paid or provided anything for this blog post, I am only creating this post for me. If it helps you, great! I just keep looking this up every time I need it. Instead of wading through a bunch of Stack Overflow answers to find the exact magic command I need, I&#8217;m hoping I&#8217;ll start finding my own blog post in my search results. SHA-256 hash commands Here&#8217;s what I use most days. There are bound to be other ways to do this, and on more operating systems or command line shells. As well, there may be ways that are better suited for certain tasks like scripting or other automation steps.

					<description><![CDATA[Quick answer (TL;DR) Create a symbolic link from your deeply-nested folder to a shorter path using one of the following commands in an Administrator prompt. Command Prompt mklink /D {desired-path-location} {actual-path-location} PowerShell [Core] New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path {desired-path-location} -Value {actual-path-location} After you create the symbolic link, drag the desired solution into Visual Studio rather than navigating through the link in the Open dialog, which will override to the original path. Background If you like to keep all your code in a user directory on Windows, there&#8217;s a very good chance you&#8217;ve cloned a repo or started a new Xamarin.Android project that ran into issues on the first build. Most likely you have run into a path length issue. Sometimes a project is just so nested, even putting the repo in a low-level folder will still have trouble. If you read the error messages, sometimes they explicitly say there is a path length issue. Sometimes, though, it will be something unusual like this JavaTypeInfo error. I don&#8217;t know enough of the Android build process to explain the issue here, but it&#8217;s definitely looking for a file at a path location that is 269 characters long.

					<description><![CDATA[If you&#8217;re looking for more retro gaming than the NES games that come free with your Nintendo Switch Online subscription, you might be interested in playing some Japanese Famicom games. Turns out you can do this without any additional cost. I&#8217;m not suggesting you load an emulator on your Switch, though that seems like an option these days. It&#8217;s not totally straightforward, but it&#8217;s not too challenging either. And it definitely won&#8217;t leave your Switch in a state where you&#8217;re afraid to let it update. One warning, though. The ads on your Switch home screen now have the ability to show up in either English or Japanese. Why would you want the Famicom app? You might just want it because you can. (It&#8217;s me!) If you were a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber in Japan, the free retro gaming app is what you would get by default with your subscription is the Famicom app. (And you&#8217;d be looking for the reverse instructions to play NES games.) It has all the appropriate cover art images, some of which are just awesome. So, maybe the cover art could sell you on it. There were also several games that were slightly different when released... <a class="continue-reading-link" href="https://www.patridgedev.com/2019/02/06/play-japanese-famicom-games-with-your-us-nintendo-switch-online-account/"> Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594; </span></a>]]></description>

Next, let&#8217;s get a little more advanced with our parameters to make our life easier. In this post, we&#8217;ll create a template symbol that will function like a coalesce operator, taking a preferred input but falling back to a different input if the preferred value is not found. This is the third in a collection of posts about creating custom templates for the dotnet new system. Sample code This is the third in a series of posts about creating custom templates for the dotnet new system. I’ll be working from the results of the prior blog post, but the approach can be used to add this functionality to any dotnet new template. If you want a starter template project to get you going, you can clone the Git repo from that blog post and start from the prior 2-input-parameters template. Why a coalesce/fallback symbol? There are bound to be several great reasons to need a fallback variable, or one that coalesces between multiple potential inputs, but here are a few I&#8217;ve run across so far.

					<description><![CDATA[Previously, I covered creating your first custom dotnet new template. Now, let&#8217;s work on customizing the content our template generates based on inputs provided via the command line. I’ll be working from the same custom template from that post, which is just a dotnet new console output with its own .template.config setup. If you want a starter template project to get you going, use the template from the 1-custom-template folder from the Git repo from that blog post. This is the second in a collection of posts about creating custom templates for the dotnet new system. Your first input parameter When you are generating content from a template, your first parameter for controlling things is built in to the SDK. There are two variables used to decide where to put the generated content: --output and --name. If you provide a path via --output "some/path", the content will be generated in that location. If, in your template&#8217;s template.json file, you set "preferNameDirectory": true, you can set the same path via --name "some/path". (If you have the preferNameDirectory variable set to true and provide both an output and name variable, it will use the output value.)

					<description><![CDATA[Why make a template I am a bit biased these days, but once I spin up a folder structure and/or text document manually more than twice, I give some thought to templating it. If I need to keep making more of something, the time to get all the boilerplate content in place is time taken away from the good stuff I want to write. This is the first in a series of posts about creating custom templates for the dotnet new system. How to template There are lots of templating systems out there that can allow you to create content quickly. If you have used any of the ASP.NET generators, those use Yeoman to spin up new ASP.NET projects quickly. I&#8217;m not saying any template engine is better here, just showing what I&#8217;ve been using lately. I have been using the templating engine built into the .NET Core SDK, since it tends to be installed on all my development machines. The .NET Core template system is exposed through the dotnet new command-line program, where the dotnet program is able to do way more stuff like compiling code, managing NuGet packages, or running .NET Core applications.

					<description><![CDATA[I was recently tasked with cleaning up some Markdown content with a bunch of screenshots. Sometimes as content was revised, an image would no longer be used, but the image wasn&#8217;t deleted. As a result, the images folder would often be packed with files that were no longer used in the final Markdown content. On a few blocks of content, I would do this manually in VS Code. From the file list (Ctrl+Shift+E), I’d select the file, copy the file name (F2, then Ctrl+C), search all the files for that file name (Ctrl+Shift+F, then Ctrl+V). This was painful to do for more than a few blocks, so I decided to turn to automation, Powershell in this case. PowerShell is available on Windows and Linux/macOS, so it’s great for wherever I need it. It even seems to properly translate my path separators on different platforms. Getting the image file names There are a lot of aliases in PowerShell, they make some verbose commands either shorter and easier to remember, or they duplicate functionality found in the host system. For example, the dir command is available in PowerShell, but it is actually an alias for the Get-ChildItem command.

I&#8217;ve wanted to find a way to support HTTPS traffic on my blog for a while, but I wanted to find a solution that would Just Work™ without me doing the leg work. I&#8217;ll stick to writing the blog posts and let someone else worry about hosting details. Just like anything security-related, setting up SSL intimidates me a bit (more so because this often involves the dark magic of DNS records). I&#8217;ll do security when I have to, but my prerequisite is always that I read so much about the topic I feel comfortable explaining every decision I make to either an expert or someone completely unfamiliar with the topic. Encrypting patridgedev.com traffic This blog is currently a WordPress site on a host using AdminPanel. I have spent hours in IIS for ASP.NET sites, but almost nothing on Linux hosting. It&#8217;s all just me poking around hoping to find things.

					<description><![CDATA[A little piece of magic wandered into my Twitter feed recently. Between the Windows IoT stuff I messed with this summer, controlling LEDs via Xamarin.Forms, and this awesome news, I&#8217;m bound to be learning the hardware side of things a little better. Netduino is back! https://t.co/gU2CNIWFYE&#8212; Netduino (@netduino) July 20, 2017 That&#8217;s right, Netduino has returned; this time Wilderness Labs has taken the reins (with Bryan Costanich heading things up). Netduino is a hardware platform, similar to Arduino with lots of input and output options through a bunch of pins on the board, that allows interacting with it using .NET. Not only has Wilderness Labs resurrected Netduino, they have released three new boards: Netduino 3, Netduino 3 Ethernet, and Netduino 3 WiFi. According to the Wilderness Labs Netduino docs, these new boards are as fast as ever, all running Cortex-M4 processors at 168MHz, and with more flash storage and a bump in RAM: the base Netduino 3 has 384KB of flash (matching the old Netduino 2 Plus), and the Netduino 3 Ethernet and Netduino 3 WiFi both have a bump to 1,408KB. If it wasn&#8217;t obvious, the Netduino 3 Ethernet board also offers a 10/100 Ethernet port, and the Netduino... <a class="continue-reading-link" href="https://www.patridgedev.com/2017/09/11/return-of-netduino-net-on-small-hardware/"> Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594; </span></a>]]></description>

And it has been glorious! If an early UI design needed a few pixels shaved or added to an image we were using, no new images were needed, let alone a handful of pixel-density variations on it. It was just the few lines of code or XAML to change the rendered size. (In fact, I&#8217;ve extended our use to include stretchable buttons by adding 9-slice SVG support.) With SVGs, you use one tiny XML file to render the resulting image at any size or for any screen density. TL;DR Put SVGs in a PCL as an EmbeddedResource build action Use an SVG control (I recommend TwinTechsForms.NControl.SvgImageView, but there are other choices.) Add an SvgImageView to your C# or XAML UI the the right assembly and resource path Without SVG Images Images on iOS and Android are normally managed in slightly different ways regarding naming and location. For better or worse, Xamarin.Forms continues using these image conventions, making a detour from the focus on cross-platform sharing.

					<description><![CDATA[There comes a time in cross-platform development where you inevitably long for a simpler mechanism for dealing with the deluge of image assets. You end up with three or more sizes of every single image with different names for every platform. At Twin, SVGs have risen to that challenge for us, and we use it everywhere we can with a custom variant of Paul Patarinski&#8217;s SvgImage control. After some minimal setup work to start using them, they render crisply at any size and resolution we throw at them. One place that SVG use has had shortcomings for us is when we needed backgrounds with varying sizes. We need a unique SVGs for each size we intend to use because you haven&#8217;t been able to selectively stretch an SVG like you could with 9-patch images on Android or StretchableImage/CreateResizableImage on iOS. In SVG terms, this appears to be called 9-slice support, and it is something we want to both use in our apps as well as make available to you. I recently took an experimental journey toward bringing 9-slice support to SVGs drawn in cross-platform Xamarin.Forms apps.
