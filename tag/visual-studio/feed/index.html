					<description><![CDATA[TL;DR Never underestimate the little time sinks of switching between IDEs regularly. To write MonoTouch code in Visual Studio 2010 (debug/deploy still requires MonoDevelop on a Mac), go get VSMonoTouch. If you have any issues getting it going, you may need to toss in some project file tweaks. Set it to not reference mscorlib.dll Set the System.Web.Services reference to version 2.0.5.0 (and likely any others that may conflict with the latest .NET runtime assemblies). Background I&#8217;ve been programming with MonoTouch for a few months now using MonoDevelop. I really enjoy learning new things (even if MonoTouch saved me from learning Objective-C), but switching IDEs always tosses a few kinks in my productivity. I have tweaked a number of key bindings in MonoDevelop to match Visual Studio, some at the cost of my ability to adapt to the Mac&#8217;s defaults that are normally used everywhere. At one point I switched copy and paste to use Ctrl in MonoDevelop, but then I kept screwing up outside of the IDE. Regardless, I have become fairly productive in MonoDevelop from simply adapting to the new system through repetition (often screwing up when I switch back to Windows now). I don&#8217;t really have a problem... <a class="continue-reading-link" href="https://www.patridgedev.com/2012/12/10/monotouch-programming-in-visual-studio/"> Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594; </span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Visual Studio 2017 Undo-Close Update: The Productivity Power Tools have spun off into a bunch of more-focused extensions. To get Undo Close in Visual Studio 2017, you will want the Power Commands extension now. Visual Studio 2013 Undo-Close Update: Since the prior options for re-opening closed tabs fell apart with the release of Visual Studio 2013, you will need the newly released Productivity Power Tools 2013. Update: now with the ability to re-open closed tabs with Ctrl+Shift+T. This also allows you to re-open tabs closed by a project file reload, which is fantastic! Ever tried to close a tab in Visual Studio 2010/2012 with Ctrl+W. If so, you find yourself selecting the current word in your text editor (Edit.SelectCurrentWord). I don&#8217;t use that shortcut, though I could see it being handy over my usual Ctrl+Shift+Right-/Left-Arrow. I do, however, use Ctrl+W to close windows/tabs in just about every other program I use. In order to make that shortcut work for your Visual Studio editing, you just need to assign it to File.Close instead. For the visual, here&#8217;s a snapshot similar to what you will want (note: I already made this change before snapping a pic, so yours may look slightly different).... <a class="continue-reading-link" href="https://www.patridgedev.com/2012/02/14/closing-tabs-in-visual-studio-with-ctrlw/"> Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594; </span></a>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Background Today, while incorporating Lee Dumond&#8217;s MVC Route/URL Generation Unit Tester into a project, I found a desire to contribute some code I thought would make the package easier to use. Unfortunately, the project code formatting looks nothing like my preferred conventions (some form of 1TBS, I guess). Until Visual Studio offers a way to distribute code style settings to source control consumers easily, I needed a different option. While preparing demos for a mobile web development talk for the Cheyenne Computer Professionals group, I stumbled on Mike Minutillo&#8217;s tip for running a &#8220;demo&#8221; instance of Visual Studio where I could sandbox my presentation settings optimized for an elderly VGA projector. This sparked an workaround idea for dealing with multiple formatting settings of various projects I may work on. Rather than force my conventions on the project (generally not acceptable) or give up on my own style (generally not acceptable), I decided to try using a &#8220;demo&#8221; instance of Visual Studio with that projects styling conventions set. Right-click where I want the shortcut. Specify a path to Visual Studio 2010 using the /RootSuffix option. On 64-bit Windows, %programfiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe" /RootSuffix YourStylingNameHere On 32-bit Windows, %programfiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe"... <a class="continue-reading-link" href="https://www.patridgedev.com/2011/12/01/adapting-visual-studio-code-styling-differences-for-open-source-project-contribution/"> Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594; </span></a>]]></description>
